### Introduction

Neural Networks are most widely used in deep learning today. You will hardly find a benchmarks that is not dominated by Neural Networks. Everything from Image recognition to Machine Translation. It is the same Neural Networks with some variations, that achieves or surpasses Human Level Performance. In this post I will explain the most Fundamental type of Neural Network called **Feed-Forward Neural Network**. 

 *So, Let's delve deeper in Feed Forward Neural Networks*

### Neurons : The Building block

Neurons are the most fundamental unit of  neural networks. Before I describe an Artificial Neuron. Let's have a look at the biological Neuron or Nerve Cell.

From Wikipedia

> A **neuron**  is an [electrically excitable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Membrane_potential) [cell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)) that receives, processes, and transmits information through electrical and chemical signals.

So, this biological definition is pretty acceptable for Artificial Neurons as well. Artificial Neuron (Neurons) also recieves some values and processes then transmits the results.

In reality there is No Picture of an Artificial Neuron, Nor does it exists in codes. It is all abstracted under the shades of mathematics. Yet, I will give you an intuition about Artificial Neurons.
