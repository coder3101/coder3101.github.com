Neural Networks are most widely used in deep learning today. You will hardly find a benchmarks that is not dominated by Neural Networks. Everything from Image recognition to Machine Translation. It is the same Neural Networks with some variations, that achieves or surpasses Human Level Performance. In this post I will explain the most Fundamental type of Neural Network called **Feed-Forward Neural Network**. 

##  Neurons

Neurons are the most fundamental unit of  neural networks. Before I describe an Artificial Neuron. Let's have a look at the biological Neuron or Nerve Cell.

From Wikipedia

> A **neuron**  is an electrically excitable cell that receives, processes, and transmits information through electrical and chemical signals.

So, this biological definition is pretty acceptable for Artificial Neurons as well. Artificial Neurons also recieves some values, processes and then transmits the results.

There is no standard way of visualizing a neuron in artificial neural networks. I assume a **neuron as a bucket that simply stores any real number**. So, stick to this Idea, It will get more clear as you progress in the post.
