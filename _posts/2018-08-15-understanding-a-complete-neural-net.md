Today in this post I will explain the Complete neural network and the intuition about how a neural network learns from data.

By the end of this post, you will have the in-depth understanding of forward and backward propagation in a feed-forward neural network. I will focus on the math part as well and we will be using [numpy](https://pypi.org/project/numpy/) for numerical calculations in python. In the end, you will be able to implement the complete neural network with forward porpagation.

This post assumes that you have an basic understanding of activation functions and are familiar with terms like weights and biases. If all these seem alien to you. Read [this](https://coder3101.github.io/understanding-ff-nn/)  and come back here again.
